    "text": "This document demonstrates the use of a number of advanced page layout features to produce an attractive and usable document inspired by the Tufte handout style and the use of Tufte‚Äôs styles in RMarkdown documents (Xie, Allaire, and Grolemund 2018). The Tufte handout style is a style that Edward Tufte uses in his books and handouts. Tufte‚Äôs style is known for its extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and well-set typography. Quarto1 supports most of the layout techniques that are used in the Tufte handout style for both HTML and LaTeX/PDF output.1¬†To learn more, you can read more about Quarto or visit Quarto‚Äôs Github repository.\n\nXie, Yihui, J.

Other layout options (for example placing a figure in the margin) will be set per element in examples below.\n\n\nThese layout features are designed with two important goals in mind:\n\nTo produce both PDF and HTML output with similar styles from the same Quarto document;\nTo provide simple syntax to write elements of the Tufte style such as side notes and margin figures. If you‚Äôd like a figure placed in the margin, just set the option fig-column: margin for your code chunk, and we will take care of the details for you2.\n\n2¬†You never need to think about \\begin{marginfigure} or &lt;span class=\"marginfigure\"&gt;; the LaTeX and HTML code under the hood may be complicated, but you never need to learn or write such code.If you have any feature requests or find bugs in these capabilities, please do not hesitate to file them to https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues."
